We need to fix incorrect calculations in Step 7 and unblock the "Next" button.

**Task 1: Fix `server/services/pricingEngine.ts`**
The `calculateProjectPricing` function is returning incorrect totals.
* **Review the logic:** Ensure you are fetching `project_units` joined with `home_models` and `financials`.
* **Recalculate Components:**
    * `totalDesignFee`: Sum of `home_models.design_fee` for all units.
    * `totalOffsite`: Sum of `home_models.offsite_base_price` for all units.
    * `totalOnsite`: Sum of (`home_models.onsite_est_price` for all units) PLUS `financials.prelim_onsite` (the additional site buffer).
* **Fix Grand Total:** Explicitly set `grandTotal = totalDesignFee + totalOffsite + totalOnsite`.
* **Console Log:** Add a `console.log` inside the function to print these 4 values so we can debug the math in the server logs.

**Task 2: Fix Validation in `client/src/components/wizard/WizardContext.tsx`**
The `validateStep` function (case 7) is blocking progress because it checks for legacy fields that may now be 0 or empty in the frontend state.
* **Remove old checks:** Delete validation logic for `designFee`, `preliminaryOffsiteCost`, `deliveryInstallationPrice`, `sitePrepPrice`, `utilitiesPrice`, and `completionPrice`.
* **Add new check:** Only validate that `data.contractPrice` (the Grand Total) is greater than 0.
    * If `<= 0`, return error: *"Pricing data is missing. Please go back to Step 4 and add units."*
* **Keep:** The milestone percentage check (must sum to 95%).

**Task 3: Update `Step7Pricing.tsx` State Sync**
* In the `Step7Pricing` component, locate where `pricingSummary` is fetched.
* **Add Effect:** When `pricingSummary` loads, call `updateProjectData` to sync these values into the wizard state:
    * `contractPrice`: `pricingSummary.grandTotal`
    * `designFee`: `pricingSummary.breakdown.totalDesignFee`
    * `preliminaryOffsiteCost`: `pricingSummary.breakdown.totalOffsite`
    * `preliminaryOnsiteCost`: `pricingSummary.breakdown.totalOnsite`
* This ensures the context has the correct values to pass the new validation check in Task 2.

After these changes, Step 7 should show the correct Grand Total (sum of components) and the Next button should be enabled.
