Excellent! Step 4 (Financial Terms) is complete and working well. Let's move on to Phase 8: Step 5 - Schedule & Warranty.

🤖 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT - PHASE 8: Schedule & Warranty Step
CREATE WIZARD STEP 5: SCHEDULE & WARRANTY TERMS

Add a new step to the contract wizard for collecting schedule, timeline, warranty periods, and legal jurisdiction information.

LOCATION: src/components/wizard/steps/ScheduleWarrantyStep.tsx

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. SCHEDULE SECTION:
   - Effective Date (date picker, default: same as Agreement Execution Date from Step 1)
   - Estimated Completion Timeframe:
     * Number input (6-24 range)
     * Dropdown: "months" or "weeks"
     * Default: 12 months
   - Design Phase Duration (days, default 90, range 30-180)
   - Manufacturing Duration (days, default 120, range 60-365)
   - On-Site Duration (days, range 30-180):
     * Default: 90 days if CRC
     * Default: 60 days if CMOS
   
2. TIMELINE VISUALIZATION:
   - Show visual timeline preview with phases:
     * Design → Manufacturing → On-Site → Completion
   - Display calculated end dates for each phase
   - Warning if timeline seems unrealistic (e.g., total > 24 months)
   - Use simple progress bar or Gantt-style display

3. WARRANTY PERIODS SECTION:
   Header: "Warranty Terms"
   Subtext: "Standard warranty periods per Dvele policy"
   
   Three warranty inputs (in months):
   - Fit & Finish Warranty (default 24, range 12-36)
   - Building Envelope Warranty (default 60, range 36-120)
   - Structural Warranty (default 120, range 60-240)
   
   Display conversion to years for clarity:
   - Example: "24 months (2 years)"
   
   Show all three in table format with:
   - Warranty Type | Duration (months) | Duration (years)

4. LEGAL JURISDICTION SECTION:
   Header: "Legal Jurisdiction & Venue"
   Subtext: "Auto-populated from site address, verify accuracy"
   
   - Project State (dropdown, auto-filled from site address in Step 3, editable)
   - Project County (text input, required)
   - Federal Judicial District:
     * Dropdown or auto-calculate based on state and county
     * Example values: "Central District of California", "Southern District of New York"
     * Include tooltip explaining what this is
   
   - Arbitration Provider:
     * Radio buttons: JAMS vs AAA
     * Default: JAMS
     * Show brief description:
       - JAMS: "Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services"
       - AAA: "American Arbitration Association"

5. AUTO-CALCULATIONS:
   - Calculate estimated completion date:
     estimatedCompletion = effectiveDate + designPhaseDays + manufacturingDays + onsiteDays
   
   - Calculate warranty expiration dates:
     fitFinishExpires = estimatedCompletion + (fitFinishMonths * 30 days)
     envelopeExpires = estimatedCompletion + (envelopeMonths * 30 days)
     structuralExpires = estimatedCompletion + (structuralMonths * 30 days)
   
   - Display these calculated dates prominently

6. VALIDATION:
   - Effective Date: required, valid date
   - Completion Timeframe: required, 6-24 months
   - Design Duration: required, 30-180 days
   - Manufacturing Duration: required, 60-365 days
   - On-Site Duration: required, 30-180 days
   - Fit & Finish Warranty: required, 12-36 months
   - Building Envelope Warranty: required, 36-120 months
   - Structural Warranty: required, 60-240 months
   - Project State: required
   - Project County: required
   - Federal District: required
   - Arbitration Provider: required

7. CONDITIONAL LOGIC:
   - On-Site Duration default depends on serviceModel (from Step 2):
     * If CRC: default 90 days
     * If CMOS: default 60 days

8. UI/UX:
   - Organize into 4 clear sections (Schedule, Timeline, Warranty, Legal)
   - Use card/panel layout
   - Date pickers for all date fields
   - Show both months and years for warranty periods
   - Visual timeline/calendar display
   - Helper text and tooltips
   - Responsive layout

9. DATA MAPPING:
Store these fields in wizardData:
- effectiveDate
- estimatedCompletionMonths
- designPhaseDays
- manufacturingDurationDays
- onsiteDurationDays
- estimatedCompletionDate (calculated)
- warrantyFitFinishMonths
- warrantyBuildingEnvelopeMonths
- warrantyStructuralMonths
- warrantyFitFinishExpires (calculated)
- warrantyEnvelopeExpires (calculated)
- warrantyStructuralExpires (calculated)
- projectState
- projectCounty
- projectFederalDistrict
- arbitrationProvider

Import this step into ContractWizard.tsx and add it as Step 5.

Use existing design patterns from Steps 1-4 for consistency.
