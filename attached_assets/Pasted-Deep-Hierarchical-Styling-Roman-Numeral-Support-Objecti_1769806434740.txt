Deep Hierarchical Styling & Roman Numeral Support
Objective
Update the contract system to support four levels of hierarchy and apply a specific "clean look" styling. Level 1, 2, and 3 blocks must be left-justified with minimal hanging indents for list markers. Only Level 4 (Roman numeral sublists) should be fully indented.

Step 1: Update Schema & Ingestor
Schema: Ensure hierarchy_level in the clauses table supports values up to 4.

Ingestor (scripts/ingest_standard_contracts.ts):

Update the parser to detect Roman numeral patterns (i., ii., iii.) at the start of lines.

Assign these blocks block_type: 'list_item' and hierarchy_level: 4.

Ensure they are correctly parented to the preceding Level 3 paragraph.

Step 2: Refine Generator CSS (server/lib/contractGenerator.ts)
Modify the global styles in the generateHTMLFromClauses function to achieve the "clean look":

Level 1 (Section Headers):

Style: Bold, Blue (#1a73e8), uppercase.

Layout: Left-justified, no indent.

Level 2 (Sub-sections):

Style: Bold, black.

Layout: Left-justified, no indent. Prepend auto-generated numbers (e.g., 1.1).

Level 3 (Body Text/Paragraphs):

Style: Normal weight.

Layout: Left-justified. If it is a numbered list item, use a "hanging indent" (marker is at margin, text starts at a consistent small offset).

Level 4 (Roman Sub-lists):

Style: Normal weight, list-style-type: lower-roman.

Layout: Fully indented (margin-left: 0.5in or 36pt) to visually distinguish it from the body text.

Step 3: Update Recursive Rendering Logic
Numbering Engine:

Level 1: "SECTION X" or Roman (I, II) based on context.

Level 2: "X.X" (e.g., 1.1).

Level 3: "X.X.X" (e.g., 1.1.1) or "1." if under a Level 2.

Level 4: "i.", "ii.", "iii.".

Hanging Indent Implementation: Use a display: flex or text-indent CSS approach for Level 3 to ensure that multi-line paragraphs align perfectly under the first word of the sentence, not under the number.

Verification Task
Run the ingestor with your cleaned Word document.

Generate a "ONE Agreement" PDF.

Check Level 3: Ensure paragraphs are flush with the left margin (except for the list number).

Check Level 4: Ensure Roman numeral items (i., ii., iii.) are the only blocks significantly shifted to the right.

Check Colors: Verify all Heading 1 sections are bold and blue.
