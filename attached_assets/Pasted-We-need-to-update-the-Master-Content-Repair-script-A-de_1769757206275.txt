We need to update the "Master Content Repair" script. A deep audit of the PDF revealed significantly more ghost clauses and numbering collisions than initially identified.

**Task: Update `scripts/fix-content-master.ts` to include ALL of the following:**

1.  **Fix Numbering Collisions (Renaming):**
    * **Section 1.5:** Find "1.5. On-Site Work - CRC Client Acknowledgment". Rename to **"1.6. On-Site Work - CRC Client Acknowledgment"**.
    * **Section 3.5:** Find "3.5. Green Light Conditions". Rename to **"3.6. Green Light Conditions"** (increase `sort_order` to appear after 3.5 Financial).

2.  **Delete "Ghost Headers" (Duplicate Titles):**
    * Find and DELETE clauses with these exact names:
        * "3.2. Access to Site" (Keep "3.2. Site Access and Preparation")
        * "3.3. Legal Authority and Site Control" (Keep "3.3. Approvals and Decisions")
        * "3.5. Communication and Coordination" (The ghost text)

3.  **The "Section 7" Purge (Risk of Loss vs IP):**
    * Find and DELETE clauses containing these text strings (case-insensitive):
        * "7.1. Ownership of Work Product"
        * "7.2. License to Use Work Product"
        * "7.3. Restrictions on Use"
        * "7.4. Indemnification Regarding Work Product Use"
        * "7.5. Publicity Rights"
    * *Note:* Ensure the valid "SECTION 7 HEADER" (Risk of Loss) exists; create it if missing.

4.  **Global Ghost Busting (Sections 8, 9, 12, 13):**
    * Find and DELETE clauses containing:
        * "8.1. Damages"
        * "9.1. Scope and Milestones"
        * "12.1. Payment Default"
        * "12.2. Material Breach"
        * "12.3. Rights upon Termination"
        * "13.1. Governing Law and Venue"
        * "13.2. Entire Agreement; Amendments" (The ghost header, not the real one)
        * "13.4. No Third-Party Beneficiaries"

5.  **Execute:**
    * Expose as `POST /api/debug/fix-grandmaster`.
    * Run it immediately.

**Goal:** Zero duplicate headers, zero ghost text, and perfect sequential numbering (1.5 -> 1.6, 3.4 -> 3.5 -> 3.6).
