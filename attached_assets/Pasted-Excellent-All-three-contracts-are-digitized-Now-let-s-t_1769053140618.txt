Excellent! All three contracts are digitized. Now let's test the complete contract package generation.

STEP 1: CREATE TEST PROJECT DATA

Create a complete test dataset with values for all 89 variables. Use realistic data for a CRC project:

{
  // Project Info
  "PROJECT_NUMBER": "2025-001",
  "PROJECT_NAME": "Smith Residence",
  "TOTAL_UNITS": "1",
  
  // Dates
  "AGREEMENT_EXECUTION_DATE": "2025-02-01",
  "EFFECTIVE_DATE": "2025-02-01",
  
  // Company (SPV) Info
  "DVELE_PARTNERS_XYZ": "Dvele Partners Smith",
  "DVELE_PARTNERS_XYZ_LEGAL_NAME": "Dvele Partners Smith LLC",
  "DVELE_PARTNERS_XYZ_STATE": "Delaware",
  "DVELE_PARTNERS_XYZ_ENTITY_TYPE": "limited liability company",
  "DP_X": "Dvele Partners Smith LLC",
  
  // Client Info
  "CLIENT_LEGAL_NAME": "John and Jane Smith",
  "CLIENT_STATE": "California",
  "CLIENT_ENTITY_TYPE": "individual",
  "CLIENT_FULL_NAME": "John Smith and Jane Smith",
  "CLIENT_TITLE": "Homeowners",
  
  // Site/Delivery
  "DELIVERY_ADDRESS": "456 Oak Lane, San Jose, CA 95120",
  "SITE_ADDRESS": "456 Oak Lane, San Jose, CA 95120",
  
  // Service Model (THIS IS CRITICAL - drives conditionals)
  "ON_SITE_SERVICES_SELECTION": "CLIENT-RETAINED CONTRACTOR",
  
  // Financial - Design
  "DESIGN_FEE": "$45,000",
  "DESIGN_REVISION_ROUNDS": "3",
  
  // Financial - Preliminary
  "PRELIMINARY_CONTRACT_PRICE": "$850,000",
  "PRELIMINARY_TOTAL_PRICE": "$850,000",
  "PRELIMINARY_OFFSITE_PRICE": "$425,000",
  "PRELIMINARY_ONSITE_PRICE": "$380,000",
  "DELIVERY_AND_INSTALLATION_PRICE": "$50,000",
  
  // Financial - Final
  "FINAL_CONTRACT_PRICE": "$850,000",
  "CONTRACT_PRICE": "$850,000",
  
  // Financial - Unit Pricing
  "HOME_MODEL_1": "Dvele Ora 2400",
  "HOME_MODEL_1_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$425,000",
  "SHIPPING_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$15,000",
  "INSTALLATION_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$35,000",
  "SITE_PREP_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$120,000",
  "UTILITIES_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$80,000",
  "COMPLETION_PRELIMINARY_PRICE": "$180,000",
  
  // Unit Breakdown
  "UNIT_1_MODEL": "Ora 2400",
  "UNIT_1_SQFT": "2400",
  "UNIT_1_BEDROOMS": "4",
  "UNIT_1_BATHROOMS": "3",
  "UNIT_1_PRICE": "$425,000",
  
  // Payment Milestones
  "MILESTONE_1_PERCENT": "25",
  "MILESTONE_2_PERCENT": "25",
  "MILESTONE_3_PERCENT": "25",
  "MILESTONE_4_PERCENT": "15",
  "MILESTONE_5_PERCENT": "5",
  "RETAINAGE_DAYS": "60",
  "RETAINAGE_PERCENT": "5",
  
  // Warranty
  "DVELE_FIT_FINISH_WARRANTY": "24",
  "DVELE_ENVELOPE_WARRANTY": "60",
  "DVELE_STRUCTURAL_WARRANTY": "120",
  
  // Legal/Jurisdiction
  "PROJECT_STATE": "California",
  "PROJECT_STATE_CODE": "Cal. Civ. Code",
  "PROJECT_COUNTY": "Santa Clara",
  "PROJECT_FEDERAL_DISTRICT": "Northern District of California",
  
  // On-Site Provider (for ONSITE contract)
  "ONSITE_PROVIDER_NAME": "Premier Site Builders Inc.",
  
  // Add any other manufacturing/onsite specific variables with reasonable defaults
}

STEP 2: CALL THE CONTRACT GENERATION ENDPOINT

POST /api/contracts/generate-package
Body: { "projectData": <the test data above> }

STEP 3: VERIFY THE RESULTS

Check that the response includes:
1. All three contracts generated
2. Proper clause counts for each
3. CRC conditional clauses included (not CMOS)
4. All variables replaced
5. No [VARIABLE_NAME] placeholders

Show me:
- Response status and structure
- Clause counts for each contract
- First 1000 characters of ONE Agreement
- First 500 characters of Manufacturing contract
- First 500 characters of On-Site contract
- List of conditional clauses that were included

If any errors occur, show me the full error message.
