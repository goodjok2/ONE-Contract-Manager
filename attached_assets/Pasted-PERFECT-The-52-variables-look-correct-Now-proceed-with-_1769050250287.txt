PERFECT! The 52 variables look correct. Now proceed with all three steps:

STEP A: INSERT ALL 52 VARIABLES
Insert all 52 contract_variables into the database with the structure you've identified.

STEP B: CREATE CLAUSE STRUCTURE
Start creating clauses in this exact order:

1. DOCUMENT SUMMARY (Preamble)
   - clause_code: 'ONE-0'
   - hierarchy_level: 1
   - sort_order: 10
   - name: 'Document Summary'
   - category: 'preamble'
   - Extract the entire "What the Client is Signing" through "Peace of Mind Guarantee" text
   - Preserve ALL {{VARIABLES}}

2. RECITALS
   - clause_code: 'ONE-RECITALS'
   - hierarchy_level: 1
   - sort_order: 50
   - name: 'RECITALS'
   
   Then create subsections:
   - ONE-RECITAL-1 through ONE-RECITAL-9 (hierarchy_level: 2)
   
   CRITICAL for Recital G (the On-Site Services election):
   Create THREE clauses:
   a) ONE-RECITAL-G-BASE (the intro text explaining both options)
   b) ONE-RECITAL-G-CRC (Option A text)
      - conditions: {"ON_SITE_SERVICES_SELECTION": "CLIENT-RETAINED CONTRACTOR"}
   c) ONE-RECITAL-G-CMOS (Option B text)
      - conditions: {"ON_SITE_SERVICES_SELECTION": "COMPANY-MANAGED ON-SITE SERVICES"}

3. ATTACHMENTS LIST
   - clause_code: 'ONE-ATTACHMENTS'
   - hierarchy_level: 1
   - sort_order: 90
   - List of 6 exhibits

4. SECTION 1: Scope of Services
   - ONE-1 (main section, level 1, sort_order: 100)
   - ONE-1.1, ONE-1.2, ONE-1.3, ONE-1.4, ONE-1.5, ONE-1.6 (subsections, level 2)
   
   HANDLE CONDITIONAL TEXT:
   When you see [IF CLIENT HAS ELECTED 'CLIENT-RETAINED CONTRACTOR (CRC)':], create separate clauses:
   - ONE-1.1-CRC (with CRC condition)
   - ONE-1.1-CMOS (with CMOS condition)
   
   Same pattern for Section 1.5 which has conditional text.

STEP C: SHOW ME THE RESULTS
After inserting:
1. Show me count: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contract_variables;
2. Show me first 5 clauses: SELECT clause_code, name, hierarchy_level, sort_order FROM clauses ORDER BY sort_order LIMIT 10;
3. Show me conditional clauses: SELECT clause_code, name, conditions FROM clauses WHERE conditions IS NOT NULL;

Once I verify these look correct, I'll approve moving to Section 2 and beyond.

START NOW with these three steps.
