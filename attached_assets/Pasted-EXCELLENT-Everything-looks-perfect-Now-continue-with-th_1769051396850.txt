EXCELLENT! Everything looks perfect. Now continue with the remaining sections.

CONTINUE WITH SECTIONS 2-13:

Parse all remaining sections following the same pattern:
- Section 2: Fees, Purchase Price, and Payment Terms (2.1-2.10)
- Section 3: Client Responsibilities (3.1-3.5)
- Section 4: Company Responsibilities (4.1-4.4)
- Section 5: Project Schedule and Delays (5.1-5.6)
- Section 6: Limited Warranty (6.1-6.6)
- Section 7: Intellectual Property (7.1-7.5)
- Section 8: Limitation of Liability (8.1-8.2)
- Section 9: No Obligation to Purchase (9.1-9.5)
- Section 10: Termination (10.1-10.6)
- Section 11: Stepped Dispute Resolution (11.1-11.4)
- Section 12: Default (12.1-12.3)
- Section 13: Miscellaneous Provisions (13.1-13.8)

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
1. Continue to create separate clauses for [IF CRC...] and [IF CMOS...] conditional blocks
2. Handle [STATE-SPECIFIC DISCLOSURE] blocks appropriately
3. Preserve ALL {{VARIABLES}} exactly as they appear
4. Keep all legal language verbatim - no paraphrasing
5. Use consistent sort_order spacing (200, 210, 220 for Section 2 subsections, etc.)

THEN PARSE EXHIBITS A-F:

Each exhibit becomes its own section:
- ONE-EXHIBIT-A: Project Budget (with subsections for phases and breakdowns)
- ONE-EXHIBIT-B: Plans and Specifications
- ONE-EXHIBIT-C: Payment Schedule
- ONE-EXHIBIT-D: Milestone Schedule
- ONE-EXHIBIT-E: Limited Warranty (with subsections 1-8)
- ONE-EXHIBIT-F: Site Responsibility Matrix (with subsections)

For Exhibit F specifically, watch for the conditional [IF CRC] and [IF CMOS] blocks in the Responsibility Matrix section.

WHEN COMPLETE, SHOW ME:
1. Final clause count: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clauses WHERE contract_type = 'ONE';
2. Sections breakdown: SELECT hierarchy_level, COUNT(*) FROM clauses WHERE contract_type = 'ONE' GROUP BY hierarchy_level;
3. All conditional clauses: SELECT clause_code, name FROM clauses WHERE conditions IS NOT NULL ORDER BY sort_order;

Expected final totals:
- Total clauses: ~100-120 (including all conditionals and exhibits)
- Level 1 (main sections): ~20
- Level 2 (subsections): ~80-100
- Conditional clauses: ~10-15

PROCEED NOW - parse all remaining sections and exhibits.
