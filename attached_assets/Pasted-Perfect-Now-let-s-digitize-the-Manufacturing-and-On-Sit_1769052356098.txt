Perfect! Now let's digitize the Manufacturing and On-Site Installation subcontracts.

I have both documents uploaded:
- 8__Manufacturing_Subcontractor_Agreement_-_Company_to_Dvele_Manufacturing.docx
- 9__On-Site_Installation_Subcontractor_Agreement_-_Company_to_Service_Provider.docx

PARSE BOTH CONTRACTS IN THIS ORDER:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: MANUFACTURING SUBCONTRACT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: Extract all {{VARIABLES}} from the Manufacturing contract
Expected new variables (not in ONE Agreement):
- DP_X (the SPV entity - same as DVELE_PARTNERS_XYZ)
- Manufacturing-specific pricing variables
- Manufacturing schedule variables
- Any other manufacturing-specific variables

Add these to contract_variables with used_in_contracts including 'MANUFACTURING'

For variables that appear in BOTH ONE and MANUFACTURING:
UPDATE the existing variable to add 'MANUFACTURING' to the used_in_contracts array
Example: UPDATE contract_variables SET used_in_contracts = array_append(used_in_contracts, 'MANUFACTURING') WHERE variable_name = 'PROJECT_NAME';

STEP 2: Parse Manufacturing contract structure
The document has:
- RECITALS section
- ARTICLE 1: Scope of Services (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- ARTICLE 2: Contract Price and Payment Terms
- ARTICLE 3: Schedule and Delivery
- ARTICLE 4: Quality Standards
- ARTICLE 5: Change Orders
- ARTICLE 6: Warranties
- ARTICLE 7: Insurance
- ARTICLE 8: Termination
- ARTICLE 9: Dispute Resolution
- ARTICLE 10: General Provisions
- EXHIBITS

Create clauses with:
- contract_type: 'MANUFACTURING'
- clause_code pattern: 'MFG-RECITALS', 'MFG-1', 'MFG-1.1', 'MFG-2', etc.
- hierarchy_level: 1 for articles, 2 for subsections
- sort_order: 100, 110, 120 for Article 1 subsections, 200, 210, 220 for Article 2, etc.

Watch for any [IF...] conditional blocks (though there may be fewer than in ONE Agreement)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2: ON-SITE INSTALLATION SUBCONTRACT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: Extract all {{VARIABLES}} from the On-Site contract
Expected new variables:
- ONSITE_PROVIDER_NAME (the contractor name)
- On-site specific pricing variables
- On-site schedule variables
- Any other on-site-specific variables

Add to contract_variables with used_in_contracts including 'ONSITE'

For shared variables:
UPDATE existing variables to add 'ONSITE' to used_in_contracts array

STEP 4: Parse On-Site contract structure
Similar structure to Manufacturing:
- RECITALS section
- ARTICLE 1: Scope of Services
- ARTICLE 2: Contract Price and Payment
- ... (follow the document structure)

Create clauses with:
- contract_type: 'ONSITE'
- clause_code pattern: 'ONSITE-RECITALS', 'ONSITE-1', 'ONSITE-1.1', etc.
- Same hierarchy and sort_order patterns

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR BOTH CONTRACTS:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Preserve ALL {{VARIABLES}} exactly as they appear
2. Keep all legal language verbatim - no paraphrasing
3. Handle any conditional blocks with separate clauses
4. Use consistent sort_order spacing (100, 200, 300 for main articles)
5. Extract variables from BOTH main body AND any exhibits

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHEN BOTH ARE COMPLETE, SHOW ME:
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Total variables: SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT variable_name) FROM contract_variables;
2. Variables by contract:
   SELECT 
     CASE 
       WHEN 'ONE' = ANY(used_in_contracts) THEN 'ONE ' ELSE '' 
     END ||
     CASE 
       WHEN 'MANUFACTURING' = ANY(used_in_contracts) THEN 'MFG ' ELSE '' 
     END ||
     CASE 
       WHEN 'ONSITE' = ANY(used_in_contracts) THEN 'ONSITE' ELSE '' 
     END as contracts,
     COUNT(*) 
   FROM contract_variables 
   GROUP BY contracts;

3. Clause counts:
   SELECT contract_type, COUNT(*), 
          COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE hierarchy_level = 1) as articles,
          COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE hierarchy_level = 2) as subsections
   FROM clauses 
   GROUP BY contract_type;

4. Sample from each contract:
   SELECT clause_code, name FROM clauses WHERE contract_type = 'MANUFACTURING' ORDER BY sort_order LIMIT 10;
   SELECT clause_code, name FROM clauses WHERE contract_type = 'ONSITE' ORDER BY sort_order LIMIT 10;

Expected totals:
- Variables: 70-90 total (with shared variables across contracts)
- Manufacturing clauses: 60-80
- On-Site clauses: 80-100

PROCEED NOW - parse both Manufacturing and On-Site contracts.
