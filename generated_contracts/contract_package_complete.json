For full legal terms, refer to the full Agreement.\n\nWhat the Client is Signing:\n\nClient is entering into an agreement with Company for the design and purchase of 1 high-performance modular home(s). Services may include:\n\nOffsite Services: Design, engineering, and manufacturing\n\nOn-Site Services: Shipping, delivery, installation, and site construction\n\nServices:\n\nThe specific services selected are detailed in Section 1.1. This agreement starts with design only, with subsequent phases requiring Client approval to proceed.\n\nInitial Payment:\n\nDesign & Engineering Fee: $45,000 - Due upon signing this agreement. Work cannot begin until it's paid.\n\nThis fee covers all site-specific design, engineering, development coordination, cost estimation, and permitting support needed to provide accurate final pricing, but excludes professional fees, such as Engineer's Stamping, Site Survey's, Soil Testing and Geotechnical.\n\nPeace of Mind Guarantee: You pay only this fee until Green Light. If final pricing makes the project unfeasible, you can exit gracefully.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nPhase                         | Description                                                              | Client Pays\n------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------\nDesign & Engineering          | Work starts after signing and payment of Design Fee.

They will be refined during design as site conditions, design decisions, and permitting requirements become clear.\n\nAt Green Light, manufacturing pricing becomes LOCKED. Site pricing is refined to maximum accuracy but may be subject to change orders if unforeseen conditions arise.\n\nYou can exit after the design phase (before Green Light) having paid only the Design & Engineering Fee.\n\nOptional design work (beyond the base scope) requires Client written approval and additional fees.\n\nClient's Responsibilities\n\nOn-Site work: choose to have this included in the contract or hire your own licensed General Contractor to prepare the project site\n\nStay engaged during design.\n\nRespond to key decisions on time\n\nMake timely payments as per the agreement\n\nWhen Does This End?\n\nBefore Green Light: Either party can terminate. Client pays only for design work completed (the Design & Engineering Fee) and any third party professional fees necessary for the project.\n\nAfter Green Light: Client is fully committed to the locked manufacturing price and refined site estimates. Termination after Green Light may result in significant financial obligations per Section 10.\n\nFor questions, reach out to the assigned Company project representative.\n\nPeace of Mind Guarantee\n\nWe understand that designing and building a new home is a major decision. That's why this agreement is structured around clear milestones. At the end of each design milestone, at least until the phase called \"Green Light Production Notice,\" the Client will have the option to continue, pause, or exit the process. Client will only be responsible for work completed up to that point - no hidden commitments, no pressure.\n\nThis ensures the Client stays in control throughout the process.\n\n\nRECITALS\n\nRECITALS\n\nRecital A - Company Business\n\nCompany is engaged in the business of coordinating the design, manufacturing and installation of factory-built homes, also known as modular homes, on Client owned properties.\n\nRecital B - Manufacturer Relationship\n\nCompany will engage a third-party modular home manufacturer (\"Manufacturer\") to fabricate the Home(s) at the Manufacturer's factory facility pursuant to a separate agreement between Company and Manufacturer.
