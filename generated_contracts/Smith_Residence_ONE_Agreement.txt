Document Summary

This Master Purchase Agreement (Agreement) is made and entered into as of 2025-02-01, by and between Dvele Partners Smith LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ('Company'), and John and Jane Smith, a California individual ('Client') (collectively the 'Parties').

This section gives Client an overview of what is being signed, what to expect, and what happens at each stage of the project. For full legal terms, refer to the full Agreement.

What the Client is Signing:

Client is entering into an agreement with Company for the design and purchase of 1 high-performance modular home(s). Services may include:

Offsite Services: Design, engineering, and manufacturing

On-Site Services: Shipping, delivery, installation, and site construction

Services:

The specific services selected are detailed in Section 1.1. This agreement starts with design only, with subsequent phases requiring Client approval to proceed.

Initial Payment:

Design & Engineering Fee: $45,000 - Due upon signing this agreement. Work cannot begin until it's paid.

This fee covers all site-specific design, engineering, development coordination, cost estimation, and permitting support needed to provide accurate final pricing, but excludes professional fees, such as Engineer's Stamping, Site Survey's, Soil Testing and Geotechnical.

Peace of Mind Guarantee: You pay only this fee until Green Light. If final pricing makes the project unfeasible, you can exit gracefully.

Important Notes

Preliminary estimates at signing are based on initial information. They will be refined during design as site conditions, design decisions, and permitting requirements become clear.

At Green Light, manufacturing pricing becomes LOCKED. Site pricing is refined to maximum accuracy but may be subject to change orders if unforeseen conditions arise.

You can exit after the design phase (before Green Light) having paid only the Design & Engineering Fee.

Optional design work (beyond the base scope) requires Client written approval and additional fees.

Client's Responsibilities

On-Site work: choose to have this included in the contract or hire your own licensed General Contractor to prepare the project site

Stay engaged during design.

Respond to key decisions on time

Make timely payments as per the agreement

When Does This End?

Before Green Light: Either party can terminate. Client pays only for design work completed (the Design & Engineering Fee) and any third party professional fees necessary for the project.

After Green Light: Client is fully committed to the locked manufacturing price and refined site estimates. Termination after Green Light may result in significant financial obligations per Section 10.

For questions, reach out to the assigned Company project representative.

Peace of Mind Guarantee

We understand that designing and building a new home is a major decision. That's why this agreement is structured around clear milestones. At the end of each design milestone, at least until the phase called "Green Light Production Notice," the Client will have the option to continue, pause, or exit the process. Client will only be responsible for work completed up to that point - no hidden commitments, no pressure.

This ensures the Client stays in control throughout the process.
